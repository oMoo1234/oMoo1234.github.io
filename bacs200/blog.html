    <h1 class="h1 bg-primary p-3">Response to Coronavirus</h1>


    <p class="p1">Coronavirus is one of the more<br> relevant topic currently. I would like to explore<br> what people has said and i will give my<br> thoughts on it at the end.</p>

    <h2 class="h2 bg-primary">The CDC Response.</h2>
    <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/global-covid-19/global-response.html"><img src="https://logo-all.ru/uploads/posts/2016-04/0_cdc_logo.jpg " height="200" width="200" class="img-rounded"></a>
    <p class="p2"> When it comes to the CDC, they did write an articel on<br>
        what they are going to do during this crises. Some of the action includes trying<br> to limit the spread of the disease. They also want to help countries that are in danger of<br>
        this disease. Another thing is to do whatever they can to reduce the threat that<br>
        this disease is of the United States.(Click on the CDC Logo to go see the article.)
    </p>
    <h6 class="h3 bg-warning"> Here are some precautions the CDC recommend for the public. </h6>
    <p class="p3">
        <li class="li">Stay six feet apart</li>
        <li class="li">Cover mouth</li>
        <li class="li">Wash hands</li>
        <li class="li">Stay away from crowded places</li>
    </p>

    <h3 class="opv bg-danger"> Corona ain't that bad.</h3>
    <p class="p4"> Corona ain't that bad. I have heard people argue that corona is just like the flu.<br>
        Some say that the flu is actually deadlier. I cannot find any article that talks about this<br> but i have heard people made this argument. Some people just don't beleive in it at all. You can see these types of people at the mall at Wal-Mart or your local groceries store.<br> You can tell because they don't wear a mask or have a mask. they go in they do their business and leave. This is the beleif of some people and i will<br> now give my thoughts.</p>
    <h3 class="oopv bg-success"> My Thoughts.</h3>
    <p class="p5">My thought on this virus is simple. Everyweek I check twitter. If the medical experts that i follow says wear a mask, i wear a mask. I am also taking advantage of the small<br>
        classroom the teacher are having. Because of the small classes and no one is showing up to class <br> I am able to get 100% of the teacher's attention. I don't have to wait when I need help. I can get help right away. And this is my thought and response to the pandamic.</p>
