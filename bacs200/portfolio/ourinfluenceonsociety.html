    <p class="jesus">
        We believe that todayâ€™s society is more hostile to Christianity than ever before. Our church is here to train warriors for Christ in these days of spiritual warfare. We intend to advance the Kingdom of Christ at three levels: first, by promoting Christian principles in our own personal lives; second, by implementing the principles in our family; third, by living like Christ is in our sphere of influence in the world. The church is to facilitate this process by equipping the saints to do the work of the ministry.
