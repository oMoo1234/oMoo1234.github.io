            what they are going to do during this crises. Some of the action includes trying to<br> limit the spread of the disease. They also want to help countries that are in danger of<br>

    <h3 class="opv"> Corona Ain't That Bad</h3>
    <p class="p4"> Corona ain't that bad. I have heard people argue that corona is just like the flu.<br>
        Some say that the flu is actually deadlier. I cannot find any article that talks about this<br> but i have heard people made this argument. Some people just don't beleive in it at all. You can see these types of people at the mall at Wal-Mart or your local groceries store.<br> You can tell because they don't wear a mask or have a mask. they go in they do their business and leave. This is the beleif of some people and i will<br> now give my thoughts.</p>
    <h3 class="oopv"> My Thoughts</h3>
    <p class="p5">My thought on this virus is simple. Every week I check twitter. If the medical experts that I follow says wear a mask, I wear a mask. I am also taking advantage of the small<br>
        classroom the teacher are having. Because of the small classes and no one is showing up,<br> I am able to get 100% of the teacher's attention. I don't have to wait when I need help. I can get help right away. And this is my thought and response to the pandamic.</p>
    <h3 class="thought2"> My Thought Part 2</h3>
    <p class="p6"> Ok, So last week I didn't mind Corona, but as of today which is October 30th 2020, I am somewhat upset. My only teacher that is doing in person class has to go into quaretine because he was exposed to someone who had Corona. He will be doing online teaching for two weeks. First I have paid somewhere around $100 for my school parking ticket and for what purpose now. I don't have a reason to come to class anymore. I don't have a reason to use the paking lot. I am just giving away money to the school now. I could try to get a refund for my parking ticket but I doubt I I'll get a penny back. Thanks Corona. Another thing communicating with the teacher. now it will take forever to get help. NO more instnat help for me. Thanks Corona!</p>
