    <h1 class=" prayer bg-success mx-auto d-block">Our Family Empasis</h1>
    <p class="jesus">We believe that the family is the most important arena for practicing being like Christ. Therefore, we try to help the family function together as much as possible.<br>
        <br>

        We are trying to regain activities that use to be conducted by the family which have been abandoned to the government and other agencies.<br>
        <br>

        This church is trying to reestablish child care, health care, indigent care, and education as family and church responsibilities. I Timothy 3:4-5; 5:4
