    <h1 class=" prayer bg-success mx-auto d-block">Membership</h1>
    <p class="jesus">
        We believe the voluntary commitment to a church body is important for the individual and the church.<br>
        <br>

        Church membership means the individual considers his or her relationship to the church to be much more than simply attending services.<br>
        <br>

        Church membership is a mutual commitment of the members and leaders. With membership comes more responsibility to one another.
