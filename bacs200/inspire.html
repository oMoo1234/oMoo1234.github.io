        What makes a hero? A hero is someone who does what is right when no one is looking.
        A hero loves and not hate.
        A hero is someone who gives their all in everything they do.

        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Courage- he went and fought Thanos</li>
        <li>Sacrifice- He died fighting Thanos to try and save the world.</li>
        <liLoving - I think he loves Mary Jane.></li>
        <li>Giving their all - He fought Thanos til Thanos killed him.</li>
    </ul>

        Spiderman is a hero that everyone loves. He keeps the city safe and expect nothing
        in return.
