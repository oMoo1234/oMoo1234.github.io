    <h1 class=" prayer bg-success mx-auto d-block">Our Prayer</h1>
    <p class="jesus">Jesus said that his house would be called a house of prayer. We like to have many prayer and praise times in our church building.<br>
        <br>
        Prayer is our most effective weapon to advance the cause of Christ. We utilize praise to keep our focus on God and our spirits lifted.<br>
        <br>
        We are working at becoming effective in prayer. You will find many prayer times taking place at Reformation Baptist Church throughout the week. Prayer is an important work.
